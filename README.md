This repository holds a copy of the configuration files I use with various tools. It includes the dotfiles in themselves as well as checklists for manual configuration in some tools.

## Tools
- VSCode
- iTerm2
- Fig
- NVM
- Homebrew


## Why publish my .dotfiles?

I do it both as a way to backup/track history of my configuration files and as a way to share them with others.
